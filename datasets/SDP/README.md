SDPLIB dataset
--------------

The SDPLIB dataset is distributed as compressed SDPA sparse format files (http://euler.nmt.edu/~brian/sdplib/).
We provide the subset we use uncompressed and in plain-text, as some datasets from SDPLIB were too big for Otti to process in a reasonable time.

To read more about the SDPA sparse format (http://euler.nmt.edu/~brian/sdplib/FORMAT).

There are two directories with MPS data
1. small
2. full

## small
A subset of SDPLIB datasets that can be reproduced on a personal computer,
x86_64 architecture and > 12GB of RAM.

## full
A subset of SDPLIB datasets that can be reproduced on a large machine,
x86_64 architecture and > 200GB RAM.
